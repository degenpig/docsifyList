We are working to build the documentation for our B2B SaaS application. We have decided to use https://docsify.js.org/ as the package to manage the documentation site, but we have a few changes we need made to the JavaScript/CSS of our site.

Specifically, we are looking for help to make the following changes:

Item 1: Sidebar Behavior

Current behavior:
- The sidebar navigation displays collapsed on initial page load.

Requested Change:
- The sidebar navigation should display as expanded on initial page load. All sidebar navigation items should be visible when the site is first loaded.

Item 2: Click-To-Copy Tag

Current Behavior:
- We currently have a custom HTML tag that stylizes its content to show that the user can click to copy the contents to the user's clipboard. When the user hovers the text, a tooltip is displayed that says "Click to Copy to Clipboard". When the user clicks the text, the text is copied to their clipboard, and the tooltip text does not change.

Requested Change:
- We need your help make the tooltip text change to "Copied!" when the user clicks on the text and copies it to their clipboard.

I am also looking for your help to discuss the following needs and provide some direction related to:
- How can we create a second Docsify site that is not publicly accessible? We would like to have a place for internal articles and documentation for our internal business processes.
- Is there a way to easily modify Docsify without needing to use git? I would like to empower some of my team to use Docsify on their own, and it may be easier for them if they can make changes without using git. I would like to hear your thoughts.

I will fork our Gitlab.com repository and invite you as a contributor. You will need to make your changes and submit them to this forked repository. I will handle merging your changes into our original repo and I will also handle deploying your changes to our production site.

These tasks are preliminary. I anticipate that we will need further help with Docsify and possibly with our Angular SaaS app in the future. I would like to hire someone who can remain available for other small tasks as they come up.

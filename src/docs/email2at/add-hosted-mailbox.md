Once you have either a Hosted Sub-domain or registered a Custom Domain on the Email2AT Advanced homepage, you can begin email addresses. Follow the link home the Email2AT Advanced Console page to [add a new mailbox](https://console.mspintegrations.com/#/email2at/advanced/mailboxes/hosted/new).


## Address Types

There are 3 different types of mailbox that you can add.

* Standard - e.g `support@yourdomain.com`.
* Catch All - This will process all unmatched mail for a domain.
* Regular Expression - You can use regular expression to match certain patterns or prefixes e.g `support-*@yourdomain.com`.

If you are using the `Regular Expression` address type you can also click the `Autotask Ticket Number` link above the text input to automatically fill the regular expression with the correct expression for Autotask Ticket numebers.

## Comments

You can optionally include a comment about the particular address you are creating to give more information to others.

## Domains

Select the domains you want this mailbox to be active for. You can select one or many. After doing so, click save to create the mailbox.

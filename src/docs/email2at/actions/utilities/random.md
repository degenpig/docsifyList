You can use the Random Utility to generate random strings. It also offers you a number of configurations in order to achieve the correct format for the random string you desire.

| Variable | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `Length` | integer | The length of the random string. |
| `Include numbers` | bool | Whether or not to include numbers in the string |
| `Include uppercase letters` | bool | Whether or not to include uppercase characters in the string |
| `Include basic symbols` | bool | Whether or not to include basic symbols in the string (!@#$%^&*-_=+?) |
| `Include advanced symbols` | bool | Whether or not to include advanced symbols in the string (`~(){}[]\/.,><"') |
| `Include ambiguous characters` | bool | Whether or not to include ambiguous characters in the string (iIlLoO0) |
| `Use each character only once` | bool | Whether or not to ensure that each character is unique. (This may produce a string shorter than the intended length if there are less than 12 eligible characters ) |

| `List of characters to exclude` | string | Enter any characters that you do not want in the randomly generated string |

Next, select the type of entity you would like to create from the `Autotask Entity Type to Create` dropdown. Then you can start selecting the fields from the `Fields...` dropdown and setting their values.

You must make sure that you select all the fields that include an asterisk (`*`) in the field name, these fields are mandatory in order for the entity to be created in Autotask.
